# Renewable Electricity
 

This project is a C# console application designed to generate renewable electricity production reports. It gathers the necessary data from an XML file (renewable-electricity.xml, which contains reports on renewable electricity production for various countries in 2021) that contains structured information on the electricity generated from different renewable sources like:
- hydro,
- wind,
- solar,
- biomass.
